# Setup

If you are a new user to Sym, please read the following pages:

{% page-ref page="install/" %}

{% page-ref page="login.md" %}

Use this command to see what resources you have access to:

{% page-ref page="list-resources.md" %}

When you are ready to use Sym for SSH, ansible, or other privileged access, you can use Slack to request access:

{% page-ref page="request-access.md" %}

Check out the user guides to run your first `sym` command!
