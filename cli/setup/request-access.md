# Request Access

## Walkthrough

To request access to SSH into an instance in any environment, simply run the `/sym req` slack command. You'll be prompted for the environment, and why you need access.

After submitting this modal, a message will be posted to the channel with your request. Once it is approved, the message will be updated to indicate you have been granted access. 

Now that you have access, move on to the next step to learn how to use it.
