# Templates

Each [Workflow](../what-is-a-workflow.md) is generated from exactly one Template. A Template is the type or purpose of the Workflow. Each Template's key steps can be customized with the [Python SDK](../python-sdk/). Templates also tie together the infrastructure for each Workflow.

The Template types are:

* \*\*\*\*[**Access**](access-template.md) - for protecting access to sensitive resources
* **Response and Recovery** - for incident follow-up and disaster recovery
* **Certified Deployment** - for validating artifacts before deployment
* **Risk Assessment** - for discovering and mitigating risks
* **Policy Verification** - for keeping everyone aware of security policies
* **Role Refinement** - for improving RBAC structure
